## Abstract

Chikungunya is an Aedes-borne disease therefore its dynamics are impacted by the vectorâ€™s ecology. We analysed the spatio-temporal distribution of the first chikungunya epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, estimating the effect of the socioeconomic and environmental factors as proxies of mosquitoes abundance. We fitted spatial models using notified cases counts by neighbourhood and week. To estimate the instantaneous and the memory effect of the temperature we used a transfer function. There were 13627 chikungunya cases in the study period. The sociodevelopment index, especially in the beginning of the epidemic, was inversely associated with the risk of cases, whereas the green area proportion effect was null for most weeks. The temperature increased the risk of chikungunya in most areas and this effect propagated for longer where the epidemic was concentrated. Factors related to the Aedes mosquitoes contribute to understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban arboviral diseases.
